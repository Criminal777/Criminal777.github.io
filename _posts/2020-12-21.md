## Foothold

### Nmap scan (open ports)

![nmap](img/nmap.png)

### FTP

We can log in as `anonymous`:

![ftp](img/ftp.png)

But there are no interesting files...

Let's check what we can enumerate on the other ports ! 

### Samba

I couldn't get anything from samba:

![smb](img/smb.png)

> Maybe we have to scan more ports, but before that we have to look for potential exploits that can help us with `vsftpd 2.3.4`

### Searchsploit + Metasploit

#### vsftpd 2.3.4 

Bingo :

Unfortunately:

![msf](img/msf.png)

#### smbd 3.0.20

By running a more complete nmap scan, we get smbd version:

![nmap-2](img/nmap-2.png)

And this will lead us to root :arrow_down: 

## Root
