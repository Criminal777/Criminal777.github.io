Welcome to my personal blog! 

## Who I am?

> Definitely not an expert.

Just an eternal apprentice that want to document and share what he has learned about programming/hacking.

Here are some of my online profiles:

## What will you find on this blog?

Mostly CTF walkthroughs, maybe some cheat sheets like this [one](https://github.com/amirr0r/notes/blob/master/Infosec/pentest-cheatsheet.md#pentest-cheatsheet) and articles talking about technology.

Hope you will enjoy reading it!
